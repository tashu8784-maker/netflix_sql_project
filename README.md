**Netflix Data Analysis Using SQL
**
**Tools Used:** MySQL | SQL Queries | Data Cleaning | Data Exploration

**Project Overview**:
In this project, I analyzed a Netflix dataset using SQL to uncover valuable insights about content trends, regional contributions, and platform growth. The goal was to understand how Netflix’s library has evolved over time and what type of content dominates the platform.

**Key Steps & Insights:
**
Data Exploration: Queried total records, movie vs. TV show counts, and unique country data.

Data Cleaning: Replaced missing values in director and country columns with “Unknown” to maintain data consistency.

**Analytical Insights**:
Identified the Top 10 countries producing the most content.

Analyzed the most common ratings and release trends by year.

Discovered the most frequent directors and popular genres on Netflix.

**Advanced Analysis:**

Determined countries with the highest number of TV shows.

Found longest-duration movies, and calculated average release year by type.

Explored content growth trends using cumulative yearly analysis.

Calculated average content age on the platform.

**Outcome:**
Gained a clear understanding of Netflix’s global content distribution, top-performing categories, and evolving trends — demonstrating strong SQL querying, data cleaning, and analytical thinking skills.
